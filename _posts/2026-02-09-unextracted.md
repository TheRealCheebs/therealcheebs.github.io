I used to be into FIRE.

Not because I wanted to stop doing things, but because I wanted control — over my time, my energy, and what I worked on. I wanted to retire by 30. Then 35. Then 40. I chased that because I wanted freedom, not just a paycheck.

I’m in what you might call a mini-retirement now, though that word has always been slippery for me. What I eventually realized is that I don’t actually want to stop working. I want to stop being constrained. I want to build — and I want to build with others. Computers are the lowest-friction way I know to start from nothing, iterate endlessly, and see if an idea turns into something real, but the impulse is the same.

I still need money. That part hasn’t disappeared.

Recently, I applied for a grant to work on Cashu full time. If it comes through, it won’t change what I work on so much as how I work: lowering my burn, keeping me out of the corporate world, and letting me spend my time contributing to things I actually care about. Picking up or dropping off kids. Taking a long walk in the middle of the day. Working when I’m sharp, not performing productivity to satisfy a calendar or a room.

I’ve wanted to work on BTC-related things for years. The timing just never worked. Life got busy. Family got busy. The corporate world kept extracting my energy. If I hadn’t been fired, I probably would have stayed — because it paid well and it was familiar, even if it was soul-sucking. I talked about quitting for months. But the truth is, it’s hard to leave something stable unless you get a push. That’s why people stay in jobs they hate long after they could have left, and why some die with millions still in the bank and nothing left in their life.

Over time, I’ve started thinking about life less in terms of income and more in terms of extraction.
Who controls my time?
Who benefits from my attention?
What systems quietly drain energy, and which ones give it back?

Working on random side projects never really held my interest. Building things that matter did. I realized that shipping things that matter requires more than just code — it requires a specific kind of intent.

That instinct is what pulled me toward product thinking and eventually engineering management — trying to understand how teams actually ship things that are useful, not just impressive.

Lately, that same instinct has been pulling me into freedom-oriented tech: Cashu, open protocols, and experiments with more agentic tools and workflows. Not as a career move or a hustle, but as contribution — building inside an ecosystem that feels worth growing.

This blog is a place to leave notes while I do that.

Some posts will be technical. Some will be reflective. Many will be half-formed thoughts written mid-experiment. I’m not trying to teach or optimize here — just to think clearly in public and keep an honest account of where my energy goes.

For now, these are just notes from life.
